# Arduino

The goal of this project is to develop a game controller based on Arduino and an accelerometer (the GY-521).
The idea is really simple: the data from the sensor are mapped in order to control vehicles in a videogame like GTA, simulating the behavior of a handlebar or a steering wheel. The project is based on the Unojoy library.
The main difficulty is to calibrate the x360ce which can make the Arduino behave like a xbox360 controller.
